{\large\textit{Currently I am a PhD student in CS working in areas of natural language processing and semantic web.  I particularly enjoy open-ended and research-oriented problems and favor tools and technologies that allow me to tackle these problems most effectively, such as Python programming language.

\section{Education}
\cventry{Nov. 2011 -- Present}{PhD Student}{}{University of Fribourg}{}{
Currently I'm a PhD student at the \href{http://exascale.info/}{eXascale Infolab}, under supervision of Professor \href{http://exascale.info/phil}{Philippe Cudré-Mauroux}.
\\
My research is focused on developing new methods that provide effective knowledge extraction from unstructured technical data, knowledge processing and discovery. In particular, I worked on the following research problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tag recommendation for scientific papers based on the the ontology of scientific concepts and user's interest profile.
\item Ontology-based word sense disambiguation for scientific literature.
\item Named Entity Recognition for scientific literature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{Feb. 2010 -- Mar. 2011}{Python/Django Developer}{}{École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)}{}{
My general responsibilities were to maintain and develop new features for a scientific application running on the Python/Django platform (\href{http://sciencewise.info}{ScienceWISE.info}). The system is processing large amounts of scientific articles from the arxiv.org website on a daily basis. Every article is then linked with scientific concepts appearing in it using the manually-curated ScienceWISE Ontology. The links between articles and concepts are then used to provide a semantic search over the collections of articles.
\\\\
I have also implemented a number of sub-projects that expanded the functionality of the system, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item A full text search solution based on the Whoosh engine.
\item A multi-purpose tool to extract taxonomies of scientific concepts from external resources, such as Wikipedia and other online encyclopaedias; and further integrate them to the ScienceWISE Ontology.
\item An authentication system based on SWITCH AAI.
\item A live LaTeX-editor for writing definitions of scientific concepts.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}
The paper presenting the project received the \href{http://iswc2011.semanticweb.org/program/awards/}{best demo paper award} at International Semantic Web Conference 2011.

\cventry{Dec. 2007 -- Jan. 2010}{Infrastructure Engineer}{}{COS\&HT}{}{
My main responsibilities included implementing various infrastructure projects for customers as well as maintenance of company's internal infrastructure solutions. The stack of solutions was primarily based on the enterprise products of Sun Microsystems, such as Sun Java Identity Manager, Sun Secure Global Desktop, etc.
\\
Noticeable customer projects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead engineer in implementing Identity Management solution for Russian Federal Customs Service based on Sun Java Identity Manager.
\item Engineer in implementing infrastructure solutions for Russian regional administrations providing governmental and municipal services.
\end{itemize}
}%
\cventry{Jun. 2006 -- Nov. 2007}{Software Engineer}{}{NetCracker}{System Performance dept}{
Our department was dedicated to investigating and solving complex issues with unusually slow performance and memory leaks in J2EE applications. This work required performing lots of complex debugging and analysis of Java heapdumps.
\\\\
During my work, I have also developed a \emph{Jython} application for automated deployment of J2EE applications on \emph{WebLogic Application Server}.
